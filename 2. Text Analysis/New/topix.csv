John Colby endangered several of his so-called ""clients"" by posting their personal information on the Internet during the period Jun - Aug 2012. In each instance, he posted detailed information about their physical infirmities, health issues, and included several pictures of them. In the case of Ms Morgan, twenty-three days after John's post on Indybay, she was robbed. https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2012/06/11/...  https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2012/08/02/...  https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2012/08/26/... How much did the publishing of Ms. Morgan's health issues, vulnerabilities, and pictures contribute to her becoming a victim of the robbery? How much did the publishing of Ms Morgan's pictures aid the robber in identifying this fragile human being as a good target for a robbery? John's very quick to remind everyone that he has a PhD in Computer Science and yet even a freshman taking computer science classes knows the dangers of posting personal information on the Internet. As a PhD, John Colby's actions in that regard, were careless and negligent to the extreme.BTW, It was DON LANE who finally found housing for Ms Morgan. John Colby can't even get himself housed after numerous offenses and being evicted from Section 8 housing. https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxTKPdmfF4X8S... John's also careless about posting his own personal information and that of his sister, Pat. Pictures, home address, phone numbers, the list goes on and on. On one occasion, he even posted his credit card number. One of John's achievements: https://www.facebook.com/login.php... Check Robert Norse's June 12 FRSC show with John and Pat Colby providing comic and idiotic relief: http://radiolibre.org/brb/brb140612.mp3 --- Robert messes with the heads of John and Pat Colby.--- Pat/Jabba kisses Robert's arse throughout (non-stop ""I agree with you, Robert"")--- John the Loon comes across as ignorant (Ummmmm.... Ummmmm.... I don't know.) and is constantly being fed words from his puppet master, Pat/Jabba (we know who wears the pants in that family and it isn't John).Why would Robert bring the Colbys on the show to talk about a subject they are not competent to discuss? Two reasons... First... after listening to the Colby toadies, it makes Robert sound that much more intelligent by comparison. Second... vanity! I'm sure Robert loves the way John and Pat slobber over and yield to his points of view. Check another edition of FRSC for further moronic misadventures of the Colbys (John calls in at 1:37 and Pat/Jabba the Gut is there the entire show).

In that period, the number of white drug offenders rose steadily, from about 50,000 to more than 72,000, a 43 percent increase. The number of Latino drug offenders was virtually unchanged at about 51,000.The findings represent a significant shift in the racial makeup of those incarcerated for drug crimes and could signal a gradual change in the demographics of the nation's prison population of 2 million, which has been disproportionately black for decades.

21,Aryan Nations recruiting again in northern Idaho,Told you so,"West Milford, NJ",False,#81,12-May-09,"Through diverse peregrinations and the wisdom that comes with age, the Aryan Nations has both taken a harder stance in regards to the means and methods by which our goals can reach fruition and have developed certain strategies which are more in tune with realism, as opposed to idealism.  Neither being inspired nor proud of the stagnation of the racialist ??movement?? in general, the Aryan Nations began taking strategic steps in a direction that would lead the organization into hitherto unexplored vistas in regards to our worldview and the implementation of that worldview.  In line with the facts of the geopolitical situation today, the Aryan Nations has come to the conclusion that the stereotypical ??race hate?? line of thought that has been so cherished (and so useless) within the ??movement?? is no longer viable - and as such, it is a line of thought that will no longer be perpetuated within this organization.  The goal of the establishment of a White Aryan homeland on the North American continent has not and shall not change. We believe that the Aryan folk deserve the right to a sovereign existence and racial self-determination within a territorial area characterized by our own laws, culture and customs. This is in line with the ??Blood and Soil?? concept of Third Reich-era National Socialists and follows the logic that for a people to survive (as a distinct racial and cultural group) they must have their own land so that their own ways can be furthered amongst their own folk - to the exclusion of alternate ways of life within that specific geographic territory.  But before this can occur, however, it is prerequisite and indeed necessary that ??the System?? be disrupted and broken down. This is the same ??System?? that not only oppresses Aryans but is also responsible for oppressing all persons of whatever race or nationality who oppose the erroneous, Judaic-based authority which is the premise for System-rule.  It is our intention to see Judaic-influenced society and governmental infrastructures to be pushed into a state of perpetual revolution: as is understood, no infrastructure can survive a state of perpetual revolution - and that is entirely the point in regards to the future of the current System?? A System which denies the basic human rights of millions of people across the globe and which specifically wages war against those individuals and groups who represent a spiritual-based, numinous way of living - and as such is the exact antithesis in competition to the hollow and empty life of a consumer-slave which is the default mode of existence in the present so-called ??Western democratic states??.  We know that there are far better alternative ways of living - and far more intelligent, reasonable and cultured means of society - which can be made real upon this earth for our people and for all people.  Where we differ from our predecessors is that we realize that it takes a cold-blooded, pragmatic and realist viewpoint to enact the changes which will be necessary to achieve our goals. As such we see - for the immediate future - a period where the spread of subversion and the aid of all forms which are a liability and are inimical in nature to the current Judaic-tyrannical state of affairs should be our principal aim.  We have encapsulated the quintessence of this work in two words: Aryan War??",Spam,1,Racy,1,Nuts,1,Negative

We are not interested - nor do we intend to become - a petty debate club nor are we interested in the kind of problem-oriented futility which characterizes many of the non-mainstream political groups in North America.  The future will be decided by those who embrace evolution and continue to take - again and again - the disciplined steps needed to evolve themselves as individuals - as this microcosmic change shall be the precursor for the execution of macrocosmic change that will not simply be comparable but rather surpass that which has been achieved on an individual level.  It shall only be these individuals who will be willing - and capable - to change the world in a significant way... To redress the imbalance caused by the Jew and their hubristic sycophants and restore this earth to a state of cosmic harmony.  If this change we speak of should herald a descent into Anarchy then we say ??so be it?? with no regret or apology - for Anarchy is much preferable - and more capable - of causing the break-up of the current so-called ??superpowers?? into smaller nation-states - than is the domesticated societal situation existent at present.  And it shall be in the smoldering ashes of the downfall of the current System wherein shall be born the seeds for a new global society in which Aryan homelands shall again be a reality; that is, if we have the tenacity, dedication and intelligence necessary to make it a reality.  For those who are brave enough, defiant enough and strong enough to evolve - to cull their own selves of the anti-evolutionary religions, thought processes and politics of the past - and then to cull their planet of all that which stands in the way of our goal of perpetual revolution for our enemies (which equals the spark of life for our people) then we invite you - and challenge you - to join our struggle.",Spam,1,Racy,1,Clueless,1,Negative

When most people talk about racism, they're talking about America and it's institutions, history, and the general topic of unequal income and opportunity determined by race, where white people still maintain their position's in our society. The point is, white people categorically have an advantage, and that is why there is affirmative action and other forms of checks/balances. I understand your perspective, and agree on some points, especially because I've witnessed hispanic's being racist toward blacks, blacks being racist towards whites, etc. The difference is not an individuals contribution to racism, but the overarching societal oppression that still exists for people of color.

You say first amendment rights violations. First amendment right violation is where some one denies one their right to free speech or attempts to silence them. People must be free to speak no matter how much some one does not like what they say. They must even be free to scream fire in a crowded theater, but once they do so they can then be held accountable for the consequences. If you do not like the lies, the false propaganda or liable of those that are and must always be free to speak then you do what ever it is that you need to do to resolve the situation. You can sew them, in some cases arrest them or in this case take the law into your own hand even breaking laws, but in the end everyone will eventually be accountable one way or another. The problem with the New World Order taking over and enslaving the economic world is that they are now trying to silence people, squash their rights and even arresting people for what is now known as pre -crimes. They even imprison and torture people with out due cause or process. We now have the thought police on the horizon. We now have government denying people their rights on the false basis that people in society are fearful of ones intentions and thus they believe that one must be stopped from their actions even though no crime has yet or will be committed. As long as we have the Illuminati controlling every thing world wide and creating groups like the CIA and their Al-Qaeda or Muslim Brother hood and sending U.S. forces into other countries carpet bombing cites with landmine/cluster bombs, using depleted Uranium rockets on civilian cities, sneaking into villages and masquerading entire household of innocent citizens and drone attacking villages of civilians all in the name of going after the very terrorist that the CIA created in the first place then you are going to continue to have slow minded peasants turning into radical sud o wannabee soldiers. People all want to believe in something noble and being as the Globalist have done such a great job of taking all nobility away from man- kind, this seems to be the best that these morons can do. Given what little brain powers these people have, this is the best they will ever be able to do. They simply are not intelligent enough to realize that they are nothing more than butt puppets being used by the Evil New World Order in order to spread Anarchy Chaos and confusion in the world so that the Globalist can use their actions as an excuse to take more and more control and take away more and more freedom until we are all transformed into total obedient slaves. Divide and conquer. Use one undesirable group to destroy the other undesirable groups. Kill all the Jews with the Muslims. They use blacks to kill whites and in the end the only survivors will be the Satan worshiping Illuminati New World Order Globalist Elitist ruling all the mixed slow races of slow minded Zombie Moron Slaves. I believe that the best we can do is to not support or fall for their lies. Do not watch their brain washing television or pay for their music, games, movies, or other false brain washing forms of entertainment. Do not give them your money. Do not let them take away our rights with out taking to the streets and marching against their tyranny. Also do not let your friends and neighbors fall for all the lies without at least telling them the real truth behind the lies. The truth is not about hate or fear, the truth is about enlightenment and communication. The truth is about unity and courage. The Truth is willingness to stand out and stand up. Truth comes from education and enlightenment, but one must be willing to be open minded and willing to give of ones self. One must try to open the minds of the slow minded even when it seems impossible.",Clueless,1,Agree,1,,-1,Positive

Throughout the years, there have been many expressions of appreciation: people yelling or stopping to say thanks,??thumbs up??, and many smiles and all-fingered waves. Most got acknowledged, even if I couldn??t see you through the windshield.Most of us give what we get. My focus was safety. To reach that goal, there has to be communication and acceptance of information. That requires a certain level of respect. Part of the process was to take the time to explain what and why. The vast majority of the time, I was successful.I tried to give a break to the deserving: a lower speed, one violation instead of more, a cheaper one rather than a more expensive. Sometimes that wasn??t an option and sometimes there were those that convinced me they didn??t rate a break. One man recently even told me I should write him for things I hadn??t even noticed yet. After that, we parted with a handshake, on better terms than we met.Most of my contacts ended with a ??thanks (??Well, I really didn??t mean to say that, but????). Every contact had its own set of dynamics, some even lending themselves to a little humor (sorry you missed that,??real enemy??). Most were as pleasant as they could be, given the circumstances; a few had to be strictly professional.Clones? No, that was my evil twin on the other side of town.??Public service??- my philosophy of law enforcement. That does NOT mean, however, you get to tell me how to do my job.As a rookie deputy, I was fortunate to work with a couple of veterans who were a part of their community and imbued me with their philosophy.I won??t go too deeply into the pay topic. Suffice to say that the cost of retirement is part of the compensation package. About 10% goes into a fund managed by financial professionals. That amount is far greater than what many experts say should be put aside to provide for a certain level of retirement income.Most public employees contribute to the Federal Social Security program through other employment. However, many will not reap any benefit from the program, and the money goes to fund others?? retirement incomes.The patrol officers and sergeants at Santa Cruz PD postponed 5% raises and took 5% furloughs in order to increase the numbers of officers serving our community. Management took a 10% cut. None receive end-of-year bonuses or Christmas checks.I have, however, had to leave my wife??s birthday dinner and received telephone calls at home at 2:00 a.m. to go figure out how someone died.

John's very quick to remind everyone that he has a PhD in Computer Science and yet even a freshman taking computer science classes knows the dangers of posting personal information on the Internet. As a PhD, John Colby's actions in that regard, were careless and negligent to the extreme.BTW, It was DON LANE who finally found housing for Ms Morgan. John Colby can't even get himself housed after numerous offenses and being evicted from Section 8 housing. https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxTKPdmfF4X8S...

If an employer was fined $10k for EACH illegal they were found to have hired, the practice would stop pretty quickly and the demand for all of this cheap labor would dissipate, and the migration would cease. Dumping prohibition would also work to get rid of the underground jobs as well. The sad truth is that we are addicted to slave labor, and blaming the slaves for coming here instead of the masters who make it possible.",Interesting,1,,-1,,-1,Positive

Hitler's Nazi Germany was marked by a preoccupation with ""animal rights."" Hitler's Third Reich passed numerous animal protection laws, such as declaring that shoeing a horse was cruel, and declared an end to dissection. This reduced Man??s status to that of animals, and justified treating men as animals. Before the war was ended, the Nazis stepped up experiments on the best way to castrate a Jew without anesthesia, and turned countless men, women and children into lampshades and soap. These Nazi actions were justifiable by their belief that it was possible to ""...increase the moral standing of animals and decrease the moral standing of people, thus integrating human characteristics to animals... elevating animal life to the level of cult worship...which would lead to the spiritual and ideological changes necessary... for a new national identity."" The real political objective of ??animal rights?? is to eliminate ""unalienable rights,"" and to make way for all these other supposed rights and pervert our Bill of Rights to the point where only the perverted are protected. A favored socialist strategy is to separate the population from common sense and its own laws by bringing about chaos, clouding real issues, then bring about ??change?? through gradual ??legislation from within.?? Ruling by planned crisis is the favored method, as this short-circuits the brain??s ability to think and reason clearly about true issues. This planned chaos (such as ??animal cruelty,????puppy mills?? and ??cock fighting??) is designed to rob the nation of its creativity and life force, degrade human existence, make everything seem uncontrollable and bad, which then allows the introduction of a tyrannical form of government. The Gestapo was first used by Goring to do away with political opponents. A ""temporary"" state of emergency was declared after the Reichstag fire, but was never rescinded. This allowed the Gestapo to enforce conformity at every level of society. Block wardens monitored their neighbors, and children were recruited to inform on their teachers and parents. The Gestapo was authorized to hold people in ""protective custody"" which was really arbitrary arrest and imprisonment. At first, only political prisoners were taken under the guise of ""preventive protective custody"" and placed in SS-controlled concentration camps; later, anyone was hunted down and taken who was deemed to not fit in with SS and Gestapo vision of a perfect Aryan society.(""SS"" came from Schutzstaffel which means ""elite guard""). Today we see this same conduct and set of circumstances appearing in some of our civic institutions. The only way for one man to achieve dominion and control over another is through the darkness of IGNORANCE. Let??s get educated about our own laws, so that tyranny cannot gain a foothold in America, and so that we can once again have ??happiness and good government flowing forth?? as paraphrased by all our early education laws. We do have some beautiful laws. Let??s learn them, and insist that our civic institutions obey them for the good of our nation. God Bless America.    -Compiled by: Janet I. Fischer and S.A.

Killed and dumped up there and none of the homeless helped identify her killers. When Mike overdosed up there nobody called for help. They just left him there.

Check the below link - it references the 2OO9 25% cut for non-profits by the city. This is on top of a previous cut the prior year of 18%. The argument for the CVC vs. Non-profits was to decrease the cut to non-profits by giving a small cut 1O% to the CVC. Funding of Social Services for most City/Counties is a joint effort. The idea is that increasing social services increases the quality of the city. So there is not a hard and fast rule regarding funding responsability.

You lost because you think your right to do nearly anything YOU wish are absolute. They're not. You have to consider other peoples rights to peace in their home, regardless of where they live.

But even she had to admit that it took round the clock surveillance of one port-o-pottie alone. One used by 50 people max. Imagine a camp with 300-500 people, or more. Can you imaine to number of volunteers just to watch the bathrooms? And who would organize them 24/7/365? Someone would practically have to volunteer full time just to organize the volunteers. What about trash? Security? Daily clean up? Showers? It's now looking like a huge number of volunteers.I know. She'll say that the people staying there will perform some of these functions. But if that's the case why did it take BECKY, Ed, and Robert to simply watch the bathrooms? She basically said the campers couldn't monitor it themselves.Then there's the liability issues. Can you imagine what kind of insurance it would take to safeguard the city should something happen? Just imagine the city manager trying to negotiate an insurance contract on a plot of land where drunks, drug users, people with outstanding warrants, possible arsonists, people on sex offenders lists, etc. would be gathered. I know what the cost is for a small office, and this would be through the roof.And speaking of things happening. What if something goes wrong and someone gets injured or, God forbid, worse? BECKY was practically apoplectic when a volunteer group forgot to put salt and pepper on her table during a free dinner. Just think of her reaction if something worse than a loss of condiments happened. History proves she will be one of the first people to demand an investigation and place blame. And let's be clear, BECKY has shown her level if dedication towards volunteering for such things. Despite saying she would sleep every night at the courthouse until their demands were met, she hung out a few hours some nights. Just as she couldn't bother to volunteer for the homeless census, I highly doubt she would be volunteering much of her own time for such an endeavor.

For the most part they don't have anything to steal that's worth anything to anyone but another homeless person. When someone housed attacks a homeless person it's usually because they want to harm them, not rob them. When the community gets up in arms about the issue there are always more incidents of trollbusting, usually by teenagers. That happened at least a few times a month to the older drunks or the mentally ill people that go around yelling at random strangers.That said, I spent every morning listening to tales of who did what to who and who I had to go out and make give their stuff back or yell at for punching them. The junkies would steal anything that wasn't nailed down if they could get away with it and sometimes they even stole people's shoes right off their feet while they were sleeping. The drunks and meth users annoyed everyone so much that if they weren't starting a fight themselves someone else was punching them to get them to shut up. It wasn't like they were out there maiming and killing each other (with some rare exceptions) but if we called every punch thrown an assault the crime stats sure would jump up. It's a difficult situation because it's really dangerous to get labeled as a snitch on the street. They don't usually call the police on each other because they would get beat up for it later.* ""Troll justice"" works fine for the tougher guys but the mentally ill and loners get victimized all the time because they aren't strong enough to get their stuff back or fight to keep it. For the most part a relatively small number of people in the campground caused the vast majority of the problems. We called them the crankster gangsters and they scared me too but I couldn't show it or I would have been toast. Even now I would be afraid to post where their camps are. The monitors didn't stand a chance of controlling that level of graft and drug sales.* The exception being sex crimes in which case even the roughest guys with loads of warrants would come in and tell the cops everything that they knew about who did it.",Interesting,1,Touching,1,Helpful,1,Positive

Many, many individuals and families left the campground because they felt safer camping in groups on their own than they did trying to sleep in the middle of constant brawls and the danger of stepping on needles on the ground.

I no longer feel that way about Johnson in the least.Johnson is her own worst enemy. Her words, not DBS's, not Donny B's, not mine, not Reality Check's, not anyone else's in any of these threads, but her very own words, are what has led many to conclude that Johnson does not belong in a classroom in any capacity. A prudent person, after going there, might disappear after making such comments. Not our Johnson! She doubles down, continuing to attack those least able to defend, continuing to make ridiculous claims, even after being refuted time and time again.

One of her most stellar claims is that DS has shown remorse for what he did. The court documents paint a very different picture. More like he's learned how to tell people what they want to hear in order to make them believe he has shown remorse. At one point in his therapy DS was asked to write a letter to himself in the form of he being the little girl he killed doing the writing. He wrote that he believed little M ""loved him"" and hoped that he was happy, and that she was happy to be in heaven. His doctors and treatment team were shocked that he would write this. They asked him to re-write the letter. He was given multiple opportunities to write the letter showing any form of remorse. Eventually he did. But that's kind of like Pavlov's Dogs. Eventually he figured out how to do what was expected of him, and he did it. SOME people on his treatment team were satisfied. Others not.

There are lots of those, like Comcast cable internet service, SbcGlobal DSL, Cruzio, and countless others. You chose an ISP to give you internet access. Their job is to move your data from your computer to the place where you want it to end up. To do this they use something called a server which in this case is essentially just another computer dedicated to moving internet traffic around. That means that when you hit enter your message goes through phone or cable lines to at least one server* which then sends it on to Topix. A big ISP might route your data through any number of servers before it ends up here on Topix but a small one like Cruzio has its servers right here in town. The location that Topix shows is not the place where you are sitting at your computer, it's the place where the last server that got used is located. It can change from time to time depending on how your ISP works. If you look at my location it usually says Sebastopol even though I live in Bonny Doon because the ISP that I use sends my data to a server in Sebastopol before moving it on to Topix. Every now and then you'll see my location change to some other place because my ISP is routing things differently that day but I'm still sitting at the same computer in BD. If I take my laptop downtown and use free wireless at a coffee shop then I'm using their ISP and my location would change to wherever that server is. Does this make sense?The tl;dr version is that our messages travel from our computers to a brief stop at a server located someplace else and then on to Topix. If you aren't registered the location that is shown here is the address of the server someplace else. Does that make sense to you?*If your home machine is a server then it gets simpler but I'm sure that yours isn't one.",Helpful,1,,-1,,-1,Positive

RAPE is not a cute after-school activity for anyone, and especially for babies or little children.Unless of course you are a sick pervert who has no empathy for innocent little girls.Unless of course you are a sick pervert who thinks innocent little kids are here for the sexual satisfaction of monsters.Unless of course you are a sick pervert who gloats about hanging out in men's bathrooms or filming sex acts for hours at a time.BJ, as usual, is attempting to excuse and minimize the rape and murder of a baby. BJ has demonstrated her perverted fixation of the murderer and her cruelty toward the victim and her family.But luckily any sane reader will shortly realize that BJ is nothing but an unemployable parasitic loser who gains sexual satisfaction from playing on the misery of others. The danger occurs when someone as imbalanced and perverted as BJ reads her ravings and acts on them, as was the case with the arson attack on the City Attorney's office.So take note BJ, your portrayal of ""ONLY RAPE"" in excusing a murderer is being observed and remembered by many people.Keeping you as far away from children as possible can only be seen as a public service.

I never said that I don't make mistakes. I do. But mixing up DBS with NSF isn't all that shocking. They are BOTH rude, offensive, and hostile.   I think you're missing the point, BECKY.It's increasingly obvious that you have a hard time keeping your thoughts and ideas in order. You've attributed comments to me in the past that I never made. You've admitted that. What's being pointed out to you, once again by Buzz, is that you also do this with other people. You're showing a history of confusing people and comments. I don't think we've ever seen other people attribute your comments to other people by ""mistake"". Have we? So you seem to be alone on this one. It's an insight into how YOUR mind works. Whether it's just laziness or a more serious mental disability is not known. Maybe you should visit a doctor to help remedy the problem.This also translates over into the content of your posts. They're muddled and out of order. Sometimes outright incomprehensible. And most of the time simply inaccurate. Examples would be when you say something like ""I NEVER said...."", only for us to provide you with direct quotes from your posts where you DID make such a statement. Or when you make write ""Camp Paradise was DESTROYED by the SCPD"", when it's not what happened at all. Or that ""Donna never heard the police officer speak to her or the group"", only for us to find Donna's own statement that she DID not only hear the officer speak to her and the group, but she commented on his tone of voice when doing so. Then there's been examples of where you post a link to report to ""prove"" a point you've made, only for us to find out that the information in the link proves you wrong. Like when you told us to look at one of the homeless surveys that ultimately proved you incorrect. At which point you told us NOT to disregard the report because the information was inaccurate. You've even confused official court documents with articles written in the New York Times.There are many other examples, but the end result is that your comments are more often then not delusions and fantasy that are inaccurately written. And when caught in your ""confusion"" you resort to lies, hyperbole, distortion, fabrication, and the spreading of misinformation.We see a pattern, BECKY. And in pointing it out to you some of us wish you would seek professional help in order to get your mental capacity back on a somewhat even path. There's medication available for such things.

There is something wrong with these people, they don't seem to have much respect for anything or anyone. Originally this community was pretty good to this group of people, but in one generation they're on the way to completely trashing this entire community.

NF controls or has significant influence over criminal street gangs throughout central and northern California who claim Northerner or Norteno (Spanish for Northerner) association. The NF/Northern gang members are Mexican and mostly come from central and northern California. They are opposed to the Mexican Mafia, a gang comprised of Mexicans whose members come from Mexico and Southern California. They also are opposed to whites and blacks and discriminate on the basis of race and gender. Women are not allowed to be gang members as this is a privileged reserved for men. Mexican women can form auxiliary support groups for the men but they can not be full-fledged gang members. Asian, black or white women are not allowed to provide any support.Northern Street gangs associate with ""north"" aka Norteno aka NF, the color red, the number 14 (because N for North is the 14th letter of the alphabet) and other symbols some of which can vary between different northern criminal street gangs. As you can see from this, the gangs are formed on the basis of the most simplistic and ignorant thinking imaginable. Perhaps it is the sheer simplicity of the thought processes that attract so many ignorant people.Northern gangs may use ""Nor Cal"" as one of their self-identifying references.The reason they are criminal street gangs is that the purpose of their existence, besides being a ""club"" of like minded individuals is to obtain money and power through criminal operations. They exist to sell drugs, to rob and steal, commit extortion for financial gain, to traffic in women using them as prostitutes, etc. They also exist merely to commit violence against others in order to increase their ""status"" and ""power."" Of course, they could not exist unless there were other gangs that were ""outsiders"" or ""foreigners"" or ""others.""

No one spoke Spanish where I lived in the Midwest and grew up.I am really very sorry to say you are wrong. Mexicans are trained to hate gringos - which means - white Americans. Part of the Mexican identity revolves around their conflict with gringos and the idea that the Gringos have been keeping them down for the last 500 years. Unlike some Latin Americans whose identity is not wrapped up in being anti-gringo.That's why nearly 100,000 Mexican soccer fans at the US-Mexico soccer match in Mexico City a few years chanted over and over again in unison - ""Viva Osama! Viva Osama!"" 100,000 bigoted Mexicans is a lot of people. What is ironic about it is that about a couple dozen or so Mexicans were killed by Osama in 9-11!No one's ""looking down"" their nose at Mexicans. I know many hard-working, friendly, decent Mexicans too.In any case, what does any of that have to do with racist Latino gang members constantly robbing, assaulting and killing people in Santa Cruz County?",Helpful,3,Interesting,2,Brilliant,1,Positive

86,Gang members seen at Santa Cruz park hours before deadly shooti...,Parents pay attention ,"Berkeley, CA",False,#414,27-Apr-10,"There are plenty of kids in our schools who ARE wearing gang colors and parents who seem to be unaware (and very defensive when they are told about it) that the clothes they are buying their kids may target them for violence. What can parents do? Well, there are a number of things:1) Take your head out of the sand. Santa Cruz has a gang problem. Lots of people in town want to believe the gang problem is only in Salinas; well, they are wrong. Also, gangs are not just a ""Latino"" thing. The last two kids on the westside who were murdered were white and many of the westside wannabes are white.2) Educate yourself about local gangs, their signs, colors and neighborhoods. Gang dress changes over time and you have to stay current. Google Santa Cruz, CA gangs and you will find a number of websites to learn about them.3) Don't buy your kids gang-identified clothes. When rival gangs cruise a neighborhood looking to make trouble with the local gang members they look for the people who LOOK like they are in the gang. They don't check ID. They are often high and often stupid; they just pick someone who looks like they are in the rival gang. So, don't let your kid out of the house looking like a gang member. What does that mean? On the westside it means wearing red shirts, hats, shoe laces, Nor-Cal, W/S or Westside wear, red bandanas or belts, the number 14; on the eastside it means blue shirts, hats, shoe laces, South Pole, 13, ESSC. And support your kid's school if they call to tell you your kid has gang-related clothing on, don't argue with them that your kid isn't gang involved. But gang clothing and accessories change frequently, so you have to be vigilant. 4) Know where your kid is, who they hang out with and what they are up to. Yes, this might mean you actually have to snoop around a little. Teenagers don't usually want their parents to know everything about them. Search their rooms, look on Facebook, check out the texts in their cell phone. Look at the graffiti on their notebooks. Be involved. They need you to protect them and confront them if you find anything suspicious. 5) Just because you know your kid is a ""good"" kid doesn't mean he isn't going to be targeted by gang members. If your kid looks like a gangster, acts like a gangster, is in the places where gangs hang out and is hanging out with gang-affiliated people, he is at risk. Add alcohol and anything can happen. Yes, drunk teenage boys yell things and confront people inappropriately, and when it escalates it can be life-threatening. 6) Write to your city council members and other legislators to tell them you want gang-related juvenile offenders DETAINED in juvenile hall. Santa Cruz Co juvenile hall detains fewer juveniles than any other probation department in the state; they brag about it, get awards for it, calling it ""restorative justice"". The reality is that the policy of not detaining violent gang-related offenders allows them to remain in the community where they commit more crimes. Let the officials know you are tired of this policy and that you want gang-identified offenders detained so that our communities can be safer.",Agree,2,Helpful,2,Interesting,1,Positive

Negative status, especially for teenage boys, is preferable to no status at all.In all the years I have worked with gang kids, through many awful, violent unfortunate instances, including a number of homicides, the family NEVER admits that the kid was in a gang. That's just how it goes. I don't know if it's because of denial, not wanting to speak ill of the dead, or feeling guilty about not intervening, but the family ALWAYS says how great their kid was and that he was not in a gang. That includes kids who have been arrested over and over for gang crimes. So the fact that the family says the kid wasn't in a gang doesn't make it so. Some families have no idea what their kids are up to because they are so permissive or believe so strongly in their kid's privacy that they don't have a clue. Think Columbine. And some kids just get caught up in the fringes of the gang because they have friends who ""claim"" and they pay the price for it. I'll say again, if the kid dresses like he is in the gang, hangs out with kids who are gang involved, goes places where the gang goes, and says things that the gang says, he is likely to be targeted with the ""real"" gang members.

Continue to watch the City do nothing, or do something. So we did, and we do. I for one am not interested in the politics of who administers a Facebook page, though it should be pointed out that TJ has since moved out of state. What is it he would do from Oklahoma to help Santa Cruz? As for Ken Collins, he made a mistake and apologized. Given that Santa Cruz has a rep for giving thieves, junkies and even dealers a second chance, how about the same for someone doing good instead of bad? It should also be pointed out that he used a trash grabber, not ""a metal stick,"" which sounds like a weapon. A small point, but visualization is key for readers.

The Truth HurtsSanta Cruz, CAReply ??|Report Abuse|Judge it!|#1103Wednesday Judged:Spam2Brilliant2Agree2Agree to disagree RRby John E. ColbyWednesday Dec 11th, 2013 12:15 PMRR:You may have some legitimate issues with Robert Norse (which aren't necessarily personal ones but grounded in your beliefs about his actions).I am writing as a free agent who isn't a HUFF member. I am an unaffiliated representative and advocate for disabled and homeless people. I conduct independent research (often using public records requests) to gain information to aid me in advocating with the government and leveraging the media to ensure the problems of those I represent are solved.Speaking from my own POV, Norse has been very helpful to my advocacy. Listening to his radio shows, I often come across issues which raised my own questions (leading to me seeking answers to them through FOI requests and personal research). Norse has generously offered to (partly) fund my FOI requests for the disabled and the homeless. This is very helpful because currently I have limited resources ?? his support is aiding me help a lot of people and uncover government corruption.My take on Norse's journalism is that while it is not completely objective ?? but then who really is ?? often his interviews are illuminating and quite informative. For example, his questioning of the recent alleged victim of SCPD aggression was a good interview. Since I am an experienced interviewer ?? I often interview homeless people who can be difficult to gain useful information from ?? who passes the evidence I gather to federal and state agencies, I believe Norse's interviews, although sometimes ""chatty"", are generally of good quality.Although I don't always agree with Norse's approach to advocacy for the homeless, he has passed victims of discrimination to me and seems to genuinely care about them.RR: hopefully we can agree to disagree. I appreciate you commentary which is often very astute. There's no need to argue about this.Really Johnby The Village IdiotWednesday Dec 11th, 2013 6:47 PMWhat have you done to help the homeless John, other than to join their ranks?You're arguably worse than Norse. You're a laughing stock in the community, and by association (just like with Norse), you bring down the cause with you. Maybe you should STFU for a while. It would help the homeless cause to not have you bringing it down every time you open your mouth. You're like the clap.",Spam,4,Clueless,4,Nuts,4,Negative

Colby was evicted from the ""Citizens for a Better Santa Cruz"" Facebook group.In an email to Robert Kahn-Job on November 25, 2013, Steve Pleich states his reasons for evicting John E. Colby:""John consistently attacks those whom he deems to be engaged in some unlawful or secretive enterprise without any foundation in fact whatever. These arguments are always subject to evidence he thinks he will discover through the requests for public records that never seem to yield the substantive proof he needs. By contrast and to be fair, when you criticize or take exception to something, your arguments invariably contain some facts in support or, at least, some scintilla of evidence. I did not create CFAB SC as a forum for John's ceaseless screed about how unfair the world seems to him personally and as a whole; He has two perfectly serviceable facebook pages of his own to publish and pursue that agenda.By the way, the final ""tipping point"" for me was John's most recent attack post in which he attributed his facts in support to a ""tipster""; his word, not mine.""READERS PLEASE NOTE: The fact that John was readmitted to the CFABSC doesn't mitigate John's deranged and hostile actions as stated in Steve Pleich's email above. It DOES say that Steve Pleich is a charitable man by taking pity on the ColbyLoon and giving him yet one more chance.It's an almost certainty that John Colby will blow it yet again and be evicted in 2014.

You two lost the *debate* the moment you started posting on topix, and I don't blame others for heckling you when everyone can view multiple websites full of comments about cyberstalkers, criminals, bigots, TBSC members, SCPD friends, hate speech, and all of the other key words you've used to describe your detractors. It makes me wonder what your life was like without the internet, without blogs and forums to spam with insane dribble about conspiracies. Would you go to the library to debate the *haters*? Would you sit in your room crying, thinking about the day you could fight the big bad *haters* and win? This crap is childish, adults would've shrugged off the opinions of others and moved on. But, NO! You come back for more whackamole, taking your screenshots, writing the freaking president about your dilemmas..People think you're stupid, inept, and a failure. How do you combat that? Trolling, stalking, and harassing them? No. You fix your personal issues and get a job and pay for your existence. Stop spamming the world about your personal issues. Masking your personal issues with the homeless activism is very transparent. Speaking of homeless activism, I watched brent and jeremy's latest youtube video exploring Oregon homeless camps. Go big or go home! Don't fight the community for a small plot to place tents, get the homeless involved in solving their homelessness. Spend time with the Homeless Garden Project, try to integrate the small module system to house those that are actually working there toward gaining life skills, sobriety, and control over their lives. The rest of the drug addicted violent bums can get harassed by the cops, like housed criminals do, and go to jail. Good game, rant off.",Brilliant,6,Agree,6,Touching,5,Positive

John's very quick to remind everyone that he has a PhD in Computer Science and yet even a freshman taking computer science classes knows the dangers of posting personal information on the Internet.

I can think of two reasons. First, after listening to the Colby toadies, it makes Robert sound all that much more intelligent by comparison. Secondly, it probably was a vanity thing.

Look at what else I found at various web sites.John Colby endangered several of his so-called ""clients"" (Steve Lazow and Andrea Morgan) by posting their personal information and pictures on the Internet during the period June through 2 August 2012. In both instances, John posted particularly detailed information about their physical infirmities, health issues, and included several pictures of them on the Internet. In the case of Ms Morgan, twenty-three days after John's post in Indybay, Ms Morgan was robbed. https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2012/06/11/...  https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2012/08/02/...  https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2012/08/26/... So, how much did the publishing of Ms. Morgan's health issues, vulnerabilities, and pictures contribute to her becoming a victim of the robbery? How much did the publishing of Ms Morgan's pictures aid the robber in identifying this fragile human being as being a good target for a robbery? John's very quick to remind everyone that he has a PhD in Computer Science and yet even a freshman taking computer science classes knows the dangers of posting personal information on the Internet. As a PhD, John Colby's actions, in that regard, were careless and negligent to the extreme.  https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxTKPdmfF4X8S... John's also careless about posting his own personal information and that of his sister, Pat. Pictures, home address, phone numbers, the list goes on and on. One one occasion, he even posted his credit card number. -----One of John's achievements. https://www.facebook.com/login.php... -----Check out the June 12 edition of Robert Norse's FRSC show with John and Pat Colby providing comic and idiotic relief at: http://radiolibre.org/brb/brb140612.mp3 Throughout the show:--- Robert messes with the heads of John and Pat Colby.--- Pat/Jabba is kissing Robert's arse throughout the interview (non-stop ""I agree with you, Robert"")--- John the Loon comes across as ignorant (Ummmmm.... Ummmmm.... I don't know.) and is constantly being fed words from his puppet master, Pat/Jabba (I guess we know who wears the pants in that family and it isn't John).Why would Robert bring the Colbys on the show to talk about a subject that they do not sound very competent in discussing? I can think of two reasons. First, after listening to the Colby toadies, it makes Robert sound all that much more intelligent by comparison. Secondly, it probably was a vanity thing. I'm sure Robert just loved the way John and Pat slobbered over and yielded to his points of view. -----",Brilliant,3,Incendiary,3,Helpful,3,Positive

Those people do not look like drug dealers, haters, evil meth users, sexual deviants, or any of the other accusations. You can see they have lots of friends, they make posts about their religious beliefs, they have a child (beautiful woman too), and I remember them when I used to shop at Mission St. Safeway years ago. I've tried to understand this drama as an outsider looking in, and I have a hard time believing some of the accusations from both sides. The proof of who is a stalker, who is a troll, who attacks people, and who saves information about hundreds of citizens and continues requesting information about their communications is all on one guys online google site. The people he attacks at MGA do not share those same gross habits and qualities of documenting management family trees, conspiracy theories, and calling the police more in a week than I have in my entire life. All evidence I've read about the entire drama points toward the catalyst being the Colby's.
